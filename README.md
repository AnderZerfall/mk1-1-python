# MIDDLE TEST - 1
### Made by Androschuk Anna IPZ-23-6

Hi! That's my solution for middle test 1 CI CD.

I'd really like to add more unit tests, however, I had problems with my VENV enviroment (i use VS code), so I spent sometime figuring that out.
Hope that's will be enough!

The file structure isn't the greatest, because I was doing my best to save some time fr resolving the issue with VENV
